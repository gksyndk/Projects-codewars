# Project files

Past problems solved on codewars practices or projects I've been working on.



## Comments (bcs why not?)

Most of these are also included with my trials or attempts on the code. (Embarassing, but that's just how it is I guess.)

Seems like I am weak at logic based on my coding attempts at the challenges so I'm now focusing on improving it.
